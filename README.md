Using the previous modules from the LAB_38 following modifications have been done in the transaction.sv module.
1. Added memory interface signals as class properties.
2. Created a class constructor to initialize class properties.
3. Implement a display method to print out all properties of a transaction class.
4. Add constraints to control whether the operation is a write or read, ensuring that each transaction is correctly classified and executed as intended.
